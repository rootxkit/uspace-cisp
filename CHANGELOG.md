# Changelog

All notable changes to `uspace-cisp`. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
semantic versioning, and the published API `api/openapi.yaml` changes
additively within `/v1`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- WP-0 scaffold: the Go module pinned to `uspace-core` v1.0.0; the `api`
  process (`/healthz`, `/readyz` that reports the WP-1 migrations as
  pending, `/metrics`, the OpenAPI-generated router answering 501
  `not_implemented` as `problem+json`), the idle `deliver` process and
  `cispctl` (`version`, `config check`); the `CISP_*` configuration with
  validation, unknown-variable refusal and redaction; structured logging,
  the Prometheus registry, the periodic status line and OpenTelemetry;
  the OpenAPI 3.1 skeleton with `oapi-codegen`; the goose migration
  trees; the Makefile, the CI workflow, the Dockerfile and the reference
  deployment (`deploy/`).
- WP-1 store and versions: every table of the plan's data model in the
  two goose trees (insert-only `publications`, `publication_attempts`,
  `features`, `changes` and monthly-partitioned, hash-chained `events`;
  `features_current` unique across `zones`, `uspace_airspace` and
  `restrictions`; the `delivery_attempts` hypertable with its compression
  and 90-day retention policies); `internal/publication` (canonical
  feature rows, diff, apply, delta, change records, the deterministic
  snapshot body, ETags); `internal/store` (pools, the embedded goose
  runner, sqlc queries, the publication transaction with the per-dataset
  advisory lock, the bounded snapshot cache that serves stale when the
  database is gone); `internal/bus` (connect without giving up, the
  `CIS_CHANGES` stream, publish with acknowledgement and deduplication);
  `cispctl migrate`, `migrate status`, `rebuild-current` and
  `set-retention`; `api` and `deliver` refuse to start with pending
  migrations; `CISP_DATABASE_MAX_CONNS` and `CISP_TIMESERIES_MAX_CONNS`.
